# cassert

C-style assertions for javascript and coffee-script, running in node.js.
Extracts assertion failure messages from the expressions themselves. Based on
[better-assert](https://github.com/visionmedia/better-assert).

## Installation

    npm install cassert

## Usage

Require the module and use it as an assert function, [just as you would in C](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cassert/assert/). As long as the NODE_ENV
environment variable is not set to `production`, cassert will perform the
check. Note that for coffee-script, the assert failure message will show the
compiled javascript expression.

**Important:** The assert function must be invoked as `assert(expression)`,
`cassert(expression)`, or similar name ending on `assert`.

## Javascript Example

```js
var assert = require('cassert');

function foo(bar) {
    assert(typeof bar === 'number');
    assert(bar > 10);
}

foo(5);
```

```
AssertionError: bar > 10
    at foo (d:\git\cassert\test.js:5:5)
    at Object.<anonymous> (d:\git\cassert\test.js:8:1)
    at Module._compile (module.js:449:26)
    at Object.Module._extensions..js (module.js:467:10)
    at Module.load (module.js:356:32)
    at Function.Module._load (module.js:312:12)
    at Module.runMain (module.js:492:10)
    at process.startup.processNextTick.process._tickCallback (node.js:244:9)
```

## CoffeeScript Example

```coffee
assert = require 'cassert'

foo = (bar) ->
    assert typeof bar is 'number'
    assert bar > 10

foo 5
```

```
AssertionError: bar > 10
    at foo (d:\git\cassert\test.coffee:8:12)
    at Object.<anonymous> (d:\git\cassert\test.coffee:11:3)
    at Object.<anonymous> (d:\git\cassert\test.coffee:13:4)
    at Module._compile (module.js:449:26)
    at Object.exports.run (c:\Users\Johan\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\coffee-script\lib\coffee-script\coffee-script.js:83:25)
    at compileScript (c:\Users\Johan\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\coffee-script\lib\coffee-script\command.js:177:29)
    at fs.stat.notSources.(anonymous function) (c:\Users\Johan\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\coffee-script\lib\coffee-script\command.js:152:18)
    at fs.readFile (fs.js:176:14)
    at Object.oncomplete (fs.js:297:15)
```

## assert.equal

Asserts that two values are non-strictly equal (i.e. uses `==` to compare).

```js
var foo = 15, bar = "banana"
assert.equal(foo, "15") // OK
assert.equal(foo, bar) // Throws error:
                       // AssertionError: assert.equal: foo, bar (15 != 'banana')
```

## assert.strictEqual

Asserts that two values are strictly equal (i.e. uses `===` to compare).

```js
var foo = 15, bar = "15"
assert.strictEqual(foo, bar) // Throws error:
                             // AssertionError: assert.strictequal: foo, bar (15 !== 15')
```
